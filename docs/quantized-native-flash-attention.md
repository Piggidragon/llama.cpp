# Quantized-native CUDA FlashAttention

For a small set of measured geometries, the CUDA MMA FlashAttention kernel reads
a quantized K/V cache in place instead of casting the visible attention window to
F16 first. Results are unchanged; what goes away is the transient F16 copy.

There is no option. The backend picks the route from a fixed table of geometries,
and every geometry outside it keeps the established path.

## Why

The standard quantized-K/V MMA route casts the visible K and V window to F16
before the kernel runs, then reads that copy back:

```
2 * n_kv_heads * head_dim * sizeof(F16) * visible_tokens
```

For a four-KV-head, D=256 model that is 4 KiB per visible token, written once
and read once. The native loaders instead dequantize the current tile straight
into the shared-memory `half2` tiles that the existing MMA body already consumes,
so nothing is materialized.

The measured gain is the traffic, not the allocation: prefill at depth is up to
21.5% faster on Ada, while no measured allocation changed. See **Validation**.

## Where it applies

`ggml_cuda_fattn_native_supported()` in `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn.cu` decides
whether a kernel exists, and returns the tile shape it uses. Common to every row:

- an NVIDIA Turing, Ampere or Ada device (`sm_75` to `sm_89`); Hopper and newer
  keep the standard path until someone measures them. Ampere and Ada are
  measured, Turing is not: see **Turing** below;
- `logit_softcap == 0`;
- the same native cache type for K and V;
- the GQA optimizations apply (mask present, no ALiBi, padded K/V, aligned strides);
- for `q5_1`, a K/V base pointer and row stride that are 8-byte aligned.

The rows themselves:

| Head dim | GQA ratio | Query batch | Cache types | Tile (sm_80+) | Tile (Turing) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 256 | 2 | > 16 | `q4_0`, `q8_0` | 32x2 | 16x2 |
| 256 | > 4, not 8 | > 4 | `q4_0`, `q4_1`, `q5_0`, `q5_1`, `q8_0` | 8x8 | 4x8 |
| 512 | > 4 | > 4 | `q4_0`, `q8_0` | 8x8 | 4x8 |

Each tile shape is the one the generic `switch_ncols1`/`switch_ncols2` would pick
inside those bounds, written out so that the compiled kernel set is exactly the
selectable set. `fattn-mma-quant-decl.cuh` declares the same rows and nothing
else, so a disagreement between the two is a link error.

The two tile columns are the same rows at different widths: `switch_ncols1` caps
`ncols1 * ncols2` at 32 on Turing, so each row loses half its columns there. A
build carries both shapes and picks between them at dispatch, because one build
serves whichever card it runs on.

GQA 8 at D=256 is excluded on purpose: PR 55 records an open correctness and
memory-safety question for that geometry under graph and workspace reuse. It
needs dedicated numerical, graph-replay, shape-transition and Compute Sanitizer
coverage before it can be enabled.

`ggml_cuda_fattn_native_profitable()` then narrows those rows by KV length and by
where the cache lives:

| Row | Host-resident K/V | Device-resident K/V |
|---|---|---|
| D=256, GQA 2 | `q8_0` | `n_kv <= 1024` |
| D=256, GQA > 4 | `q8_0` | `q4_0`: `n_kv <= 1024` or `>= 16384`; `q5_0`: `n_kv >= 16384`; rest: `n_kv <= 512` |
| D=512 | never | always |

Anything else keeps the standard path. In particular the dispatcher checks the
vector conditions first, so single-token quantized decode still takes the
existing vector kernel rather than being displaced onto this route.

## Compiled type tiers

The cache-type inventory lives in exactly one place,
`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn-mma-quant-types.h`:

| Type | Tier | Compiled by |
|---|---|---|
| `q8_0` | DEFAULT | every CUDA FlashAttention build |
| `q4_0` | DEFAULT | every CUDA FlashAttention build |
| `q4_1` | EXTRA | `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON` |
| `q5_0` | EXTRA | `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON` |
| `q5_1` | EXTRA | `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON` |

The tiers mirror `ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_type_supported()`: a default build only
ever sees `q4_0` and `q8_0` caches, so native kernels for the other types would
be dead code there. The extra tier only adds the D=256 GQA-wide row, because that
is the only row those types can reach.

That gives 12 kernels in a default build and 18 with `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS`:
six and nine type-and-geometry combinations, each at both tile widths.
`scripts/fattn-native-inventory.py` reads the built library back and fails on a
missing, unexpected or duplicated one, and on any mixed K/V or logit-softcap
kernel, neither of which the route can select.

The route is CUDA only. HIP and MUSA exclude the generated instances from their
source globs and `FATTN_MMA_QUANT_AVAILABLE` keeps them from naming the kernels.

## Implementation

The patch changes the storage loaders and reuses the existing F16 MMA
attention/reduction body rather than copying a native-specific attention kernel.
Concretely:

- one `fattn_quant_type_traits<T>` per type, in `fattn-mma-quant-<type>.cuh`.
  Each `dequant()` reproduces that type's F16 cast path bit for bit, because the
  route it replaces is the reference. Which helper achieves that differs per
  type and is documented at each specialization.
- `flash_attn_ext_f16` gains `type_K` / `type_V` template parameters, defaulting
  to `GGML_TYPE_F16`, so the F16 instantiations are unchanged.
- Multi-stage cp.async loading is disabled for native tiles: the loader writes
  the tile itself, so there is no pipeline to stage.

## Scope boundary

The route is deliberately narrow, and the rows above are the boundary. Widening
it costs evidence:

- **A new cache type** owes a tile loader that is bit-identical to that type's
  F16 cast path, its manifest line, equivalence coverage, and matched runtime
  allocation and performance evidence.
- **A new row** (head geometry, GQA ratio, KV-length range) owes its own
  measurement plus a `test-backend-ops` case asserting the route it takes. The
  tile loaders assert alignment against the quant block size, and those
  assertions are what currently confine the head geometry.
- **A new device family** is a separate measured change. Ampere and Ada are
  measured; Turing compiles and follows the same table but has no numbers yet.
- **A non-zero `logit_softcap`** stays on the standard path on purpose:
  compiling the softcap specialization would double the generated kernels for a
  dispatch that cannot reach them.

## Build cost

Measured on one machine, `sm_86;sm_89`, CUDA 13.3, Release, with the Ampere and
Ada tile widths only. The base is the commit this work branched from,
`01b141fc`.

| Build | `libggml-cuda.so` | Delta vs base | Native kernels |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| base, default | 122,779,344 B | | 0 |
| base, all-quants | 182,828,488 B | | 0 |
| Ampere/Ada widths, default | 125,252,112 B | +2,472,768 B (+2.01%) | 6 |
| Ampere/Ada widths, all-quants | 186,695,944 B | +3,867,456 B (+2.12%) | 9 |

Adding the Turing widths doubles the kernel count to 12 and 18, since every row
gains one shape. The library has not been re-measured with them.

The route table is what makes both numbers small. Compiling every tile shape at
D=64, 128 and 256, every mixed K/V pair and D=512 for all five types instead
costs 98 kernels in a default build and 485 with all-quants, for +29.04% and
+130.23% over the same base, and all but 12 and 18 of them are unreachable.

## Validation

RTX 4070 (`sm_89`, Ada) and RTX 3060 (`sm_86`, Ampere), CUDA 13.3, Release,
`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86;89`.

Correctness, `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`:

| Build | CUDA0 (4070) | CUDA1 (3060) |
|---|---|---|
| default | 2936/2936 | 2936/2936 |
| all-quants | 3949/3949 | 3949/3949 |

Route, `test-backend-ops -o NATIVE_QUANT_EQUIVALENCE`: each case compares the
native result against the same attention over an F16 copy of the same cache, and
asserts which path the dispatcher took by reading the backend's native-launch
counter. A default build runs 6 native and 3 fallback cases, an all-quants build
9 and 6. The CI job asserts those counts, so a run that selects nothing fails
instead of passing vacuously.

Kernel inventory (`scripts/fattn-native-inventory.py`): 12 cases in a default
build, 18 with `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS`, exactly the declared set and nothing
else. Regenerating the instance files reproduces the committed ones.

### Turing

Not measured. `sm_75` compiles and links, and the route table gives it the same
rows at the narrower tile widths, but no Turing card has run the equivalence
cases or a throughput comparison. Treat the route there as untested.

One thing does carry over from the Ampere result: the D=256 regression on Ampere
comes from the native loaders forcing `nstages = 0`, which costs a two-stage
cp.async pipeline the F16 path would have used. Turing has no cp.async, so its
F16 path already runs at `nstages = 0` and the native route gives up nothing.
The Ada thresholds in `ggml_cuda_fattn_native_profitable()` still apply there
unchanged, so a Turing run selects the same rows a measurement would compare.

### Throughput

Kernel-level, `test-backend-ops perf -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`, native against the
F16-casting path with the cast kernel included in both timings. Rows that stay on
the F16 path in both builds move by at most 0.4% on the 4070 and 1.7% on the
3060, which is the noise floor for these numbers.

| Route row | n_q | 4070 (Ada) | 3060 (Ampere) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| D=256, GQA 6, `q4_0`, n_kv 16384 | 512 | -21.5% | +0.3% |
| D=256, GQA 6, `q4_0`, n_kv 16384 | 2048 | -15.8% | +2.4% |
| D=256, GQA 6, `q4_0`, n_kv 1024 | 512 | -6.8% | +6.7% |
| D=256, GQA 6, `q4_0`, n_kv 1024 | 2048 | -3.7% | +10.8% |
| D=256, GQA 6, `q8_0`, n_kv 512 | 512 | -3.5% | +9.3% |
| D=256, GQA 6, `q8_0`, n_kv 512 | 2048 | +0.9% | +13.9% |
| D=256, GQA 2, `q4_0`, n_kv 1024 | 512 | -17.2% | +1.9% |
| D=256, GQA 2, `q4_0`, n_kv 1024 | 2048 | -9.5% | +7.5% |
| D=256, GQA 2, `q8_0`, n_kv 1024 | 512 | -17.0% | +1.0% |
| D=256, GQA 2, `q8_0`, n_kv 1024 | 2048 | -7.0% | +9.2% |
| D=512, GQA 16, `q4_0`, n_kv 4096 | 512 | -12.2% | -15.6% |
| D=512, GQA 16, `q8_0`, n_kv 4096 | 512 | -6.4% | -5.1% |

Every row is faster on Ada. On Ampere the D=512 rows are the largest win of any
row on either card, and the D=256 rows are slower.

The cause is the loading pipeline, not the loaders. Every D=256 entry in the MMA
config table sets `nstages_target = 2` and every D=512 entry sets `1`. The native
loaders write the shared-memory tile themselves, so they force `nstages = 0`: at
D=256 that gives up a real two-stage cp.async pipeline, at D=512 there is none to
give up. Ada absorbs the loss and Ampere does not.

The D=256 rows are kept on Ampere anyway, because that is where the route saves
the transient copy and because the loss is bounded. Staging the quantized tiles
through cp.async would remove the tradeoff and is the obvious follow-up.

End to end, Qwen3.8-27B-UD-IQ2_M (D=256, 24 heads, 4 KV heads, GQA 6) with a
`q4_0` cache on one GPU, route asserted by the native-launch counter:

| Test | 4070 off | 4070 on | 3060 off | 3060 on |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `pp512` | 1179.46 | 1178.58 | 534.05 | 533.54 |
| `pp2048 @ d16384` | 982.61 | 1022.77 | 453.35 | 450.35 |
| `tg64 @ d16384` | 33.27 | 33.34 | 17.53 | 17.62 |

t/s, higher is better. Decode is unaffected because a single-token query stays on
the vector kernel.

### Memory

The transient F16 copy that this route removes did not change any measured
allocation on this base.

Reserve compute buffer, Qwen3.8-27B-UD-IQ2_M at 16K context on one 4070, is
505.28 MiB with a `q4_0` cache, 505.28 MiB with `q8_0`, and 505.02 MiB with
`f16`, which has no copy to remove at all. Peak device memory sampled during a
`pp2048 @ d16384` run is 10419 MiB with the route on and with it off.

So on this base another node sets the high-water mark and the copy never reaches
it. The route is worth taking for the throughput above, not for the memory. A
model with more KV heads, or a tree where attention dominates the compute
buffer, may still show the saving; nothing here measures that.
